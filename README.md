## All About Coral Reefs 
#### by Sophia Ladwiniec


### Overview
You will be guided at first through a quick questionnaire to bring awareness to your typical daily activites. Don't worry not everyone is perfect these questions are just to shed light on how what you are doing everyday could easily change to help our coral reefs! After that it will show you how your daily tasks can affect coral reefs. The last portion is an interactive reef that will allow you to learn more about coral reefs and learn about the animals in coral reefs. 


### How it works
Each page will have directions based on what to do. There are buttons which allow you to click to different pages and also be vary that for the question part you are supposed to press the key for the answer you choose. Each animal in the interactive reef you can click on and it will take you to a page about the animal with a short animation. 

### Technical Details 
To plan this project I used Adobe Xd to plan out each state and as well what items would take you to which pages.

For this project I used p5.js. I implemented two libraries as well those being the play library and clickable library. For the play library I implemented it in order to make animations on each animal page in my project. For the clickable library I implemented it inorder to allow buttons to be clickable objects and allow for changes of states. In addition to these two libraries I used arrays, global and local variables, groups, and callback functions.
